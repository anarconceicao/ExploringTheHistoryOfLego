Exploring The History Of Lego

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, I exploreed the Rebrickable database and answered a series of questions related to the history of Lego!
